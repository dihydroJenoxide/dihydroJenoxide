### Hi 👋 I'm @dihydroJenoxide

#### :octocat: I’m a Senior Manager for Docs Content here at GitHub

At work:
- 😻 I love helping others do their best work and facillitating collaboration
- 👩‍🏫 As a former teacher, I use a learning lens when I work on docs

For fun, I:
- 🥾 Wander outside frequently 🏞️ 
- 🤿 Hold my breath as long as I can and pretend I'm a mermaid 🧜‍♀️
- 🖌️ Brush color on canvas and paper and digital spaces and walls 🎨
